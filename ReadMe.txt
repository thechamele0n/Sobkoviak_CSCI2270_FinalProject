I am going to be creating a text based fantasy adventure game like those of the 80s. It will incorporate a system where you choose your class and will be able to fight monster on your journey to discover the treasure at the end of the dungeon.

This point of this game is to use your chosen class's abilities to overcome the challenges in each room and make it to the treasure at the end. At any point, you can enter the command "options" and see all the abilities available to your class. When you enter these abilities into the terminal, be sure not to use any capitols and type them exactly as they are printed in the options menu. In the second and fourth rooms, you are presented with options other than what is available to your class. You will need to use one of the options presented to you to succeed. Failure at any point results in needing to restart from the beginning.

This program uses graphs as a map for the tunnels you will be navigating with each each node on the graph being an individual room that is hard coded into the graph. The value for the player's class determines the path through the tree although, given more time, it would be quite easy to implement a random number generator to determine the order of the rooms that you would move through. For aditional questions on the code, I can be contacted at alec.sobkoviak@colorado.edu.

It requires no additional libraries and should run well on any of the main operating systems. Compile and run it just as you would any other c++ program.

I am the sole group member and contributor.
To my knowledge there are no bugs or issues with the code.
